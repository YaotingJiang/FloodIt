The game goes as follows:
	When you click a cell, the first cells at the top left will change to the color
	of the cell that you clicked on. If any cells adjacent to the top left cell have
	the new color, then when you click on another cell of a different color, they 
	will all change to the new color. You goal is to make all the cells on the board
	change to the same color in the required number of clicks as displayed on the 
	right of your screen. The number of times you click will be kept track of and
	updated, so there's no need to do that yourself.
	
	GOOD LUCK!
